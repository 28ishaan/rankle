# Privacy Policy for Rankle

**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Introduction

Rankle is an iOS application developed to help users create and manage ranked lists through pairwise comparisons. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

### No Personal Information Collected by Us

Rankle does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers or third-party services. We do not operate any servers or data collection services.

### Local Data Storage

All ranked lists, items, media attachments, and rankings are stored locally on your iOS device using the device's secure file system. This data includes:

- List names and configurations
- Item titles and rankings
- Media files (photos/videos) you attach to items
- Custom color preferences

### iCloud and CloudKit Integration

For collaborative lists (shared rankings with other users), Rankle uses **Apple's iCloud/CloudKit** service to synchronize data across devices. When you enable collaboration on a list:

- The list and collaborator rankings are stored in your **private iCloud database**
- Data counts against your **personal iCloud storage quota** (5GB free per Apple account)
- Data is encrypted by Apple and synced across your devices signed into the same iCloud account
- Data is shared with collaborators you explicitly invite via sharing links
- **No media files** (photos/videos) are synced for collaborative lists to optimize storage

**Important Notes:**
- Collaborative features require you to be signed into iCloud
- You can use Rankle entirely offline for non-collaborative lists
- All collaborative data is managed through Apple's CloudKit - we do not have access to your data
- You can disable collaboration at any time, which will stop CloudKit syncing for that list

### No Third-Party Services

Rankle does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app does not contain any advertising or monetization features. We do not use any third-party SDKs that collect data.

### Network Access

- **Non-collaborative lists:** Rankle operates entirely offline and does not require internet connectivity
- **Collaborative lists:** Requires internet connectivity and an active iCloud account to sync with other collaborators

## Your Rights

Since your data is stored locally or in your iCloud account:

- **You have complete control** over your data at all times
- **You can delete your data** at any time by deleting the app or removing lists
- **You control collaboration** - you choose which lists to share and with whom
- **Your data is private** - we cannot access your iCloud data or local device data
- **You own your data** - everything is stored in your personal iCloud account or on your device

## Data Security

- **Local data:** Security is managed by Apple's iOS operating system using standard file system encryption
- **CloudKit data:** All data synced via CloudKit is encrypted by Apple using industry-standard encryption
- **Access control:** Only users you explicitly share links with can contribute to collaborative lists
- **No external servers:** We do not operate any servers, so there is no risk of data breaches on our infrastructure

## Data Sharing

Rankle allows you to share lists with other users through deep links. When you share a list:

- A compressed link is generated containing the list data
- The recipient can import the list into their own Rankle app
- For collaborative lists, recipients can contribute their own rankings
- You control who can access your lists through sharing

**We do not:**
- Track who you share lists with
- Monitor list contents
- Access any shared data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Summary

**Rankle respects your privacy:**
- We collect zero personal information
- All data stays on your device or in your personal iCloud account
- We don't track you, analyze you, or share your data with anyone
- Collaborative features use Apple's secure CloudKit infrastructure
