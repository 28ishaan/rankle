# Rankle

An iOS app to create and manage ranked lists via quick 1v1 matchups.

## Description

Rankle helps you rank your favorites through simple pairwise comparisons. Whether you're ranking movies, music, restaurants, or anything else, Rankle breaks down the complex task of ordering large lists into easy 1v1 choices.

## Features

### Create Custom Lists
- **Named Lists**: Create lists with custom names and icon colors
- **Batch Add**: Enter multiple items at once using comma-separated values (e.g., "Item A, Item B, Item C")
- **List Types**: Choose between regular ranking lists or tier lists (S, A, B, C, D, F)

### Intelligent Ranking
- **Add & Rank**: Add new items to existing lists and rank them efficiently without disrupting your current order
- **Full Re-Rank**: Refresh your entire list ranking when preferences change
- **Binary Insertion**: Uses smart algorithms to minimize comparisons and find the perfect spot for each item

### Tier Lists
- **Drag & Drop Organization**: Organize items by dragging them into tiers (S, A, B, C, D, F)
- **Visual Tier System**: Color-coded tiers make it easy to categorize your items
- **Unassigned Items**: Start with all items unassigned and organize them at your own pace
- **No Matchups Required**: Skip the ranking process and organize items directly into tiers

### Media Support
- **Images as Items**: Add images directly as list items (not just text)
- **Attach Photos & Videos**: Add media to any item in your list

### Collaborative Lists

- **Real-time Sync**: See collaborator rankings update in real-time via iCloud/CloudKit
- **Aggregated Rankings**: View combined rankings from all contributors
- **Note**: Tier lists are not available for collaboration (regular lists only)

### Privacy First
